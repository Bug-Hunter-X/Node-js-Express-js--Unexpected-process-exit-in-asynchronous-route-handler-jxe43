# Node.js Express.js: Unexpected process exit in asynchronous route handler

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Node.js Express.js applications related to the use of `process.exit()` within asynchronous route handlers.  Calling `process.exit()` prematurely can lead to unexpected behavior, such as incomplete responses to clients or abrupt server termination before cleanup tasks are finished.

The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution to mitigate this issue using proper asynchronous handling and error management.

## Problem

The primary issue lies in the asynchronous nature of Express.js route handlers.  When `process.exit()` is called, the Node.js process exits immediately. Any subsequent code within the handler, including sending the response to the client, might not be executed, resulting in incomplete or missing responses.
